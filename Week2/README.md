Hi This is My Week 2 Assignment

#### The Species I picked 
poecilia_mexicana
Poecilia mexicana (Atlantic molly) is a small freshwater fish in the family Poeciliidae, native to Central America. Itâ€™s closely related to the guppy and is often studied in evolutionary biology and environmental adaptation.


#### How I download the GFF document and analze the files when I firstly get them
```bash
wget https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/poecilia_mexicana/Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3.gz
rm *.txt
gunzip Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3.gz
ls -l
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | wc -l
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | head
```

#### How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? Does that match with the expectation for this organism?
```bash
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | grep "##sequence-region" | wc -l
```
```bash
The output is 18105 which is unexpect for this organism
```

#### Remove Save lines not starting with '#' to pm.gff3 
```bash 
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | grep -v '##sequence-' | head
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | grep -v '#' | head -1
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | grep -v '#' > pm.gff3
ls -lh
```

#### How many features does the file contain
```bash
grep -v "^#" pm.gff3 | wc -l
```
```bash
839033
```

#### How many genes are listed for this organism?
```bash
cat Poecilia_mexicana.P_mexicana-1.0.115.gff3 | grep -v "^#" pm.gff3 | cu
t -f3 | grep "^gene$" | wc -l
```
```bash
24072
```

#### top 10 annotated feature types
```bash
cat pm.gff3 | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq |head
cat pm.gff3 | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c |head
cat pm.gff3 | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn |head -10
```


#### Output
```bash
353979 exon
345083 CDS
34933 mRNA
26104 five_prime_UTR
24074 gene
18400 three_prime_UTR
18105 region
17522 biological_region
359 ncRNA_gene
190 snoRNA
```

#### Is there a feature type that you may have not heard about before? What is the feature and how is it defined?
```bash
The feature name that I haven't heard is snoRNA, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that primarily guide chemical modifications of other RNAs, mainly ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, and small nuclear RNAs.
```

#### Through the analysis of the data it seems like this species is well-anotated organisms, but the number of chromosomes indeed surprised me.
